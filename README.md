<h1 align="center"> üõ°Ô∏è Network-Level DDoS and DoS Prediction Using Ensemble Learning Approach with Mitigation Strategies </h1>


<h2 align="center">üöÄ AttackNetZero ‚Äì DDoS, Dos Detection & Analysis System </h2>

## üìå Project Overview
**AttackNetZero** is an academic **cybersecurity and ethical hacking project** developed using **Python + Django** for real-time **DoS/DDoS attack detection, mitigation, and traffic analysis**.  

This system integrates:
- A **VirtualBox testbed** for simulating real-world cyberattacks.
- **Packet sniffing & monitoring** using `scapy`, `pyshark`, and Linux network tools.
- **Machine Learning pipeline** with **stacking ensemble learning** for accurate classification.
- A **Django-based web interface** to make traffic analysis more user-friendly than CLI-only tools.
- **Admin/User role-based control** for security & monitoring.

## ‚öôÔ∏è VirtualBox Setup

| VM Role           | OS              | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üñ• Guest 1        | Windows XP      | Victim machine (target of DoS/DDoS attacks).                           |
| üêß Guest 2        | Kali Linux      | Attacker machine ‚Äì used to launch DoS/DDoS attacks (SYN Flood, etc.).   |
| üîê Guest 3        | Kali Linux      | Defender ‚Äì runs **AttackNetZero Django app** for monitoring & detection.|

**Tools inside VMs**:  
- **Nmap** ‚Üí used to scan ports/services and mimic real-world black hat hacker reconnaissance.  
- **Wireshark / TShark** ‚Üí for packet capture & inspection.  
- **iptables** ‚Üí for IP blocking/mitigation from within AttackNetZero.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Attack Types Implemented

The following **DoS/DDoS attacks** were simulated between Kali (attacker) and Windows XP (victim):

| Attack Type | Protocol | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **SYN Flood** | TCP | Exploits TCP handshake by sending excessive SYN requests, exhausting resources. |
| **ACK Flood** | TCP | Floods target with ACK packets, bypassing firewall rules. |
| **RST Flood** | TCP | Sends many RST packets to reset existing connections. |
| **FIN Flood** | TCP | Uses TCP FIN flag to prematurely close connections. |
| **PSH Flood** | TCP | Sends PSH flag packets to overwhelm target buffers. |
| **UDP Flood** | UDP | Sends large numbers of UDP packets to random ports, causing resource exhaustion. |
| **ICMP Flood (Ping Flood)** | ICMP | Floods victim with ICMP Echo Requests (pings). |
| **Fragmentation Flood (Frag Flood)** | IP | Sends fragmented packets to overload reassembly buffers. |

‚úÖ These traffic patterns were captured and stored for ML training/testing.

## üß† Machine Learning Pipeline

The ML pipeline was designed for **DDoS detection in real-time**:

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Merged multiple `.csv` network logs.
   - Cleaned labels and balanced dataset using **SMOTE**.
   - Label-encoded categorical features (e.g., Protocol).
   - Applied **StandardScaler** normalization and saved scaler (`scaler.pkl`).

2. **Hybrid Feature Selection**
   - Mutual Information.
   - Tree-Based Importance (XGBoost + Random Forest).
   - RFECV for feature elimination.

3. **Ensemble Learning (Stacking)**
   - **Base models**: XGBoost, KNN, SVM, MLP.
   - **Meta-model**: Random Forest.
   - Combined predictions for higher robustness.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Used `RandomizedSearchCV` for optimal parameters (neighbors, learning rate, layers, etc.).

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
   - Confusion Matrix analysis.
   - Stacked ensemble outperformed individual models.
