# ⚙️Setups

This project demonstrates a **safe, isolated environment** for simulating DoS/DDoS attacks and defending against them using a Django-based detection and mitigation system.  

The setup is built on **VirtualBox** with three guest systems:  

- **Victim:** Windows XP  
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux  
- **Defender:** Windows 10/Linux running Django ML-based detection  

---

## ⚙️ VirtualBox Setup

### Step 1: Install VirtualBox and Guest OS
- Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
- Create **three virtual machines**:
  - Windows XP (Victim)
  - Kali Linux (Attacker)
  - Windows 10/Linux/Kali Linux (Defender)

### Step 2: Configure Network Adapters for Kali Linux (Defender)
Each Defender should have **two adapters**:
- **Adapter 1 (Internal Network):**  
  - Name: `inet`  
  - Mode: *Internal Network*  
  - Used for communication between VMs.  

- **Adapter 2 (Bridged Adapter):**  
  - Used only on **Defender system** for internet access.  
  - Ensures **host and other real devices are not affected**.  

### Step 3: Install VBoxGuest Additions
On all VMs:
- Enable **bidirectional clipboard & drag/drop**.
- Create a **shared folder** (e.g., `SharedAttackNet`) between host and Kali Linux.
- Copy the **Django project** into Kali’s `~/home` directory.

---

## 🌐 IP Address Configuration

1. Assign **static IPs** on each VM (Internal Network Adapter):
   - Victim (XP): `192.168.100.10`
   - Attacker (Kali): `192.168.100.20`
   - Defender (Win10/Linux/Kali Linux): `192.168.100.30`

2. Verify connectivity using `ping`:
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.100.10   # From Kali to XP
   ping 192.168.100.30   # From XP to Defender
   ```
## 🖥️ System Roles
  - Victim: Windows XP

  - Open Task Manager → Monitor CPU & Network usage.

  - Observe traffic spikes during attacks.
    
    ### Attacker: Kali Linux

    Use hping3 to simulate attacks:
    ```bash
    sudo hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 192.168.100.10   # SYN Flood
    sudo hping3 --udp -p 80 --flood 192.168.100.10   # UDP Flood
    sudo hping3 --icmp --flood 192.168.100.10        # ICMP Flood
    ```
    - Target: Victim (Windows XP).
  ### Defender: Windows 10/Linux/Kali Linux (Django ML Detection-AttackNETZERO)

  1. Move Django project into home directory using shared folder.

  2. Run setup script to install dependencies:
     ```bash
     chmod +x setup.sh
      ./setup.sh
     ```
  3. Start the Django project:
     ```bash
     python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
     ```
  4. Open in browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000

  5. Features:

  - Real-time packet capture (using PyShark/Scapy).

  - ML-based attack detection (Random Forest/XGBoost).

  - Mitigation:

    - Block Attacker IP (iptables on Kali or XP Firewall).

    - Monitor system health in UI.
    
## 🔒 Mitigation Strategies

Defender system can block attacker using iptables (Commandline code) AttackNETZERO provides UI for this codes:
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.100.20 -j DROP
```
- Victim system (XP) can use Windows Firewall rules to block attacker IP.

- Only windows systems needs manuel blocking in linux based system the UI based Blocking is implemented.

- Defender logs and visualization show attack detection in real-time.

## 📊 Project Workflow Summary

| System                   | Role            | Action                                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Victim (XP)**          | Target          | Observe CPU/traffic spike under attack                  |
| **Attacker (Kali)**      | Launch Attacks  | Use `hping3` to send SYN/UDP/ICMP floods                |
| **Defender (Win/Linux)** | Protect Network | Run Django ML project, detect attacks, apply mitigation |

## ✅ Verification

Ensure all systems can ping each other before starting.

Run an attack → verify traffic on XP Task Manager.

Check Django UI → attack detection alert.

Apply mitigation → verify blocked traffic.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Automate mitigation in Django using iptables integration.

Extend detection models for multi-class attack classification.

Add reporting & visualization dashboards.
